# Virtual 3D Scanner

This script is designed to simulate real world 3D scanners (Kinect, PrimeSense, etc.) in virtual environments. With this tool, you can easily create RGB-D or point cloud datasets from synthetic models, such datasets could be useful in the field related to computer graphics and computer vision.

Given a 3D mesh, a set of customizable virtual cameras scan the model from different views, the RGB-D images and corresponding point clouds are then produced. The dimension of the output point cloud is NÃ—7, which contains xyz coordinate, rgb color, and an instance index (if available).

The script is running on [Blender](https://www.blender.org) (tested on version 2.80, 2.90), the render core is from [bpycv](https://github.com/DIYer22/bpycv).


## Installation

- Python environment of Blender

    Windows:
    ```
    cd <path to blender>/2.90/python/bin
    python -m ensurepip
    python -m pip install -U pip setuptools wheel
    ```

    Linux:
    ```
    cd <path to blender>/2.90/python/bin
    ./python3.7m -m ensurepip
    ./python3.7m -m pip install -U pip setuptools wheel
    ```

- bpycv and other dependencies

    Windows:
    
    ```
    # Download openexr for windows from https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#openexr
    python -m pip install OpenEXR-1.3.2-cp37-cp37m-win_amd64.whl
    python -m pip install opencv-python bpycv
    ```

    Linux:
    ```
    ./python3.7m -m pip install opencv-python openexr bpycv
    ```

- h5py (optional), save point cloud compactly

    Windows:

    ```
    python -m pip install h5py
    ```

    Linux:
    ```
    ./python3.7m -m pip install h5py
    ```


## Usage

### Single model scanning
Two different setups are provided: `scan_single_around.py` and `scan_single_random.py`. The former creates fixed cameras from six directions around the object, pursuing a complete coverage of the object; the latter creates random cameras in each frame, which simulate the real scanning situation.

Run the following command:
```
blender -b -P scan_single_xxx.py <model_dir> <output_dir> <model_id> <save_rgbd_image> <save_pc_per_view> <save_pc_complete> <pc_per_view_size> <pc_complete_size>
```

Example:
`blender -b -P scan_single_around.py ./example_obj/model.obj ./output plane 1 1 1 2048 16384`

### Batch models scanning
Run the following command:
```
python scan_batch_shapenet.py <num_process> <dataset_dir> <output_dir> <save_rgbd_image> <save_pc_per_view> <save_pc_complete> <pc_per_view_size> <pc_complete_size>
```

Example:
`python scan_batch_shapenet.py 8 F:/datasets/ShapeNetCore.v2 ./output 1 1 1 2048 16384`

Note: This script is tested on ShapeNetCore.v2 dataset. For other datasets, please modify the directory structure in `scan_batch_shapenet.py` accordingly.

### Arguments
- Single scan
  - model_dir: the full path to the target model
  - model_id: the unique name of the target model

- Batch scan
  - num_process: number of processors to be used, adjust according to your computer hardware
  - dataset_dir: the full path to the dataset root folder

- Common
  - output_dir: the output directory
  - save_rgbd_image: whether to save RGB-D and instance image (0 for false, 1 for true, same for below)
  - save_pc_per_view: whether to save the partial point cloud of each single view
  - save_pc_complete: whether to save the complete point cloud by combining all views
  - pc_per_view_size: the points number of the single view point cloud
  - pc_complete_size: the points number of the complete point cloud


## Customize
- Camera intrinsic:

    Modify `INTRINSIC` matrix in `scan_single_around.py` or `scan_single_random.py`

- Camera numbers:

    Modify `cam_locations` list in `scan_single_around.py` or `NUM_FRAMES` value in `scan_single_random.py`

- Lights:

    Modify `setup_blender()` function in `scan_single_around.py` or `scan_single_random.py`
